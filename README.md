# Global_Life_Expectancy

# Project Overview
This project analyzes global life expectancy data from 1960 to 2022. The analysis is presented through a series of visualizations created using Jupyter Notebooks. The primary focus is on understanding trends in life expectancy, survival rates, birth rates, and population demographics over this period.

# Features
The notebook provides the following key analyses:

# Global Life Expectancy Trends:

Observes the first recorded decline in global life expectancy starting in 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
# Comparison of Life Expectancy by Gender:

Compares the average life expectancy of men and women over the years.
Both averages have increased together over time, but the female life expectancy has consistently been higher than the male, indicating a potentially greater focus on health among women.
# Survival Rate Analysis:

Examines the percentage of men and women surviving to age 65.
Notable decline observed in 2020 and 2021, further confirming the global impact of the pandemic.
Includes two additional graphs comparing four countries:
Two countries with exemplary pandemic response policies (New Zealand and Norway).
Two countries with poor pandemic response (United States and Brazil).
In countries with effective policies, life expectancy remained relatively stable post-pandemic (comparing 2018 and 2021), while countries with poor response showed a significant decline, highlighting the consequences of inadequate support.
# Global Birth Rate Trends:

Examines the global birth rate and compares it with countries that have birth control policies.
Both rates have been declining over time, but the decline is more pronounced in countries with such policies (e.g., China).
# Population Age Group Distribution:

Compares the percentage of the population in different age groups (0-14, 15-64, 65+).
Shows a general trend of population aging, with the younger age group declining in percentage while the older groups are increasing. This is attributed to the global decline in birth rates, as shown in the birth rate graph, and advancements in medicine leading to longer lifespans.
# Detailed Analysis on China:

Further analysis related to point 4, highlighting the more significant aging population in a country like China, which has implemented strict birth control policies.
